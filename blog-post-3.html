                Your resume is your first impression, and often, your only chance to stand out. Are you making critical errors that are sending your application straight to the "no" pile? Here are the top 5 mistakes that are killing your resume and how to fix them.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8">1. Not Tailoring Your Resume</h2>
            <p>
                One-size-fits-all resumes are a relic of the past. Sending the exact same resume to every job is a surefire way to get overlooked. Recruiters spend mere seconds scanning resumes, and if they don't see an immediate match with the job description, you're out.
            </p>
            <p class="font-bold">The Fix:</p>
            <p>
                Use our <a href="index.html" class="text-indigo-600 hover:underline">AI Job Application Toolkit</a> to tailor your resume for *every single application*. Our AI identifies keywords and crucial experience from the job description and helps you integrate them seamlessly.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8">2. Focusing on Duties, Not Achievements</h2>
            <p>
                Listing your job responsibilities is good, but showing what you *achieved* in those roles is what truly makes you shine. "Responsible for managing social media" is weak. "Grew social media engagement by 30% in six months, leading to a 15% increase in lead generation" is powerful.
            </p>
            <p class="font-bold">The Fix:</p>
            <p>
                Quantify everything! Use numbers, percentages, and metrics to demonstrate your impact. Even if you think your role isn't numbers-driven, find ways to measure success (e.g., "streamlined process, saving 5 hours per week").
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8">3. Poor Formatting and Readability</h2>
            <p>
                A cluttered, hard-to-read resume frustrates recruiters. Dense paragraphs, tiny fonts, inconsistent headings, or overly fancy designs can make your document unparsable by Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and human eyes alike.
            </p>
            <p class="font-bold">The Fix:</p>
            <p>
                Opt for clean, professional templates. Use clear headings, bullet points, and ample white space. Stick to professional fonts like Arial, Calibri, or Inter (as used on this blog!). Ensure your contact information is prominent and easy to find.
            </p>

            </div>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8">4. Typos and Grammatical Errors</h2>
            <p>
                This seems obvious, yet it's one of the most common and damaging mistakes. Even one typo can signal a lack of attention to detail, professionalism, and care for your application.
            </p>
            <p class="font-bold">The Fix:</p>
            <p>
                Proofread meticulously. Read your resume backward, read it aloud, and ask a trusted friend or mentor to review it. Don't rely solely on spell-checkers; they miss context errors.
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8">5. Including Irrelevant Information</h2>
            <p>
                Your resume is a marketing document, not a biography. If an experience or skill doesn't directly support your candidacy for the job you're applying for, it's likely taking up valuable space that could be used more effectively.
            </p>
            <p class="font-bold">The Fix:</p>
            <p>
                Be ruthless with editing. Remove old, unrelated jobs (unless they show progression or transferable skills). Leave off personal hobbies unless they are directly relevant to the company culture or role (e.g., a software engineer applying to a gaming company might mention game development as a hobby).
            </p>
