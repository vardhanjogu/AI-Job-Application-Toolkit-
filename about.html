            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Our Mission</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">We built this toolkit to eliminate the most tedious and time-consuming parts of the job search. Instead of spending hours tailoring a cover letter or guessing what interview questions might be asked, our tool uses advanced AI (the Gemini API) to cross-reference your experience against specific job requirements instantly.</p>
            <p>Our goal is to make every application you submit targeted, professional, and impactful, giving you the competitive edge you need.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">How the 7 Tools Work</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">All 7 functions are powered by the same simple principle: we compare the **Job Description (JD)** with your **Full Resume Text** to find the exact match points and gaps. This is the power of prompt engineering.</p>

            <ol class="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-4 text-lg">
                <li>
                    <strong class="text-blue-600">Cover Letter Generation:</strong>
                    The AI analyzes the JD for required skills and then searches your Resume for corresponding keywords, projects, or accomplishments, weaving them into a persuasive, custom-written draft.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong class="text-blue-600">Skill Extraction & Role Mission Summary:</strong>
                    These tools rapidly process the JD to give you the 8 most critical skills to focus on, as well as a one-paragraph summary of the role's core mission, ensuring you instantly understand the job's true priority.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong class="text-blue-600">Resume Gap Identification:</strong>
                    This is a powerful self-critique tool. The AI points out 3-4 specific requirements from the JD that are not clearly met by your resume, allowing you to prepare defenses or clarify experience *before* the interview.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong class="text-blue-600">Interview Questions:</strong>
                    Generates 5 unique, highly relevant questions by comparing what the JD needs with what your resume claims, forcing you to prepare specific, difficult-to-answer questions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong class="text-blue-600">Draft STAR Response Idea:</strong>
                    Provides a structured template (Situation, Task, Action, Result) based on your resume's potential match points, giving you a ready-to-use behavioral answer template for interview practice.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong class="text-blue-600">Draft Follow-up Email:</strong>
                    Drafts a thank-you email template that strategically incorporates specific references to both the JD and your resume, making the follow-up personal and impactful.
                </li>
